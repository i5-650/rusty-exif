# How to contribute ? 
## 1. Pull requests
You can code your modifications and creare a pull request if you want it to be merged into the project. 

## 2. Contact me
If you have an idea and want it to be coded by me, you can create an `issue` or in the `discussions` section. 

## Notes
Every contribution is welcomed. I'm currently learning how to code in rust and this project is for me a way to learn.
